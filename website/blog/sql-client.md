Presto Console - SQL Client on Web UI


The Presto command line interface (CLI) is one of the de facto tools for interacting with the Presto SQL engine.
To use it, you need to download the jar file and a Java runtime. You can find detailed information
[here](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/installation/cli.html). Thanks to the [Bhuma](https://www.bhuma.dev/) team
for contributing the [presto-js-client](https://github.com/prestodb/presto-js-client) to the Presto community.
The presto-js-client enables the capability to communicate with the Presto SQL engine using JavaScript, one of the
trending programming languages. To extend the benefits of the presto-js-client even further, the Presto Console was
added to the Presto UI in version 0.286. Now you can issue the SQL queries directly from the browsers. Let's walk
through the features that the Presto Console provides.
