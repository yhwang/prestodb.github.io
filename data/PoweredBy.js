Coupled with Apache Pinot, it can handle large amounts of data at significant scale. Specifically, they've focused on utilizing Presto for projection push down. For complex SQL queries that get translated into even more complex SQL statements, they can push down certain operations to save time. They've also implemented dynamic filtering push down, which pushes the filtering down into the connector and allows for the scan to be filtered as well. This results in a significant reduction in the amount of data being scanned and processed. ",
